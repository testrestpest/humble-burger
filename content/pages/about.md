heroText: Founded on the belief that great burgers bring people together, Humble
  Burger started as a small family dream and has grown into a beloved community
  gathering place.
storyTitle: From Humble Beginnings
storyContent: >
  It all started in 2018 when Chef Maria Rodriguez decided to pursue her passion
  for creating the perfect burger. After years of perfecting her recipes in her
  home kitchen, she opened the first Humble Burger location with a simple
  mission: serve honest, delicious food made with love.


  What began as a small neighborhood spot has grown into a local institution, but we've never forgotten our roots. Every burger is still hand-crafted with the same care and attention that Maria put into those first burgers.
